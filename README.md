# Lunchbox ML: A Lightweight CLI for Local ML Model Deployment

## Overview

Lunchbox ML is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify and optimize the local deployment of machine learning models. By leveraging Docker for containerization and Typer for intuitive command-line interactions, Lunchbox ML streamlines the process of training, testing, and deploying machine learning models.

## Features

- **Simplified CLI**: Easily train, test, and deploy machine learning models using straightforward commands.
- **Docker Integration**: Run your models in isolated environments, ensuring consistency across different setups.
- **Mojo Integration**: Utilize Mojo for efficient training and inference, enhancing performance and reducing resource consumption.

## Installation

To get started with Lunchbox ML, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lunchbox-ml.git
cd lunchbox-ml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the CLI to manage your machine learning models. Here are some example commands:

```bash
# Train a model
python -m src.cli.main train --model <model_name>

# Test a model
python -m src.cli.main test --model <model_name>

# Deploy a model
python -m src.cli.main deploy --model <model_name>
```
